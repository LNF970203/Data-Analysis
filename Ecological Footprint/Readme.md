### Interpreting the Data Sets and the Variables
Data Set is about ecological footprint of production and total areas in hectares.
Ecological Footprint is a measure of how much area of biologically productive land and water an individual, population, or activity requires to produce all the resources it consumes and to absorb the waste it generates.
Variables

### Why this data selected and the message which can be given..
- Increaing CO2 concentration has caused many disasters including increasing global warmth which directly affect to the whole world's weather patterns and climate changes
- Ecological footprint is therefore an important topic in this era.
- Deriving analysis about countries and their ecological foot print balancing is more imporatnt to the countries to take firther more decisions.
as, the message, analysis of factors which affect the global hectares can be derived through correlation analysis.
- Time series analysis to identify the growths or declines of ecologicla foot prints of countries.
- What are the best countries balancing the ecological foot print arounf the world? By answering that question, other countries can follow up their polciies since this is a global phenomena.
#### Countries seletced for the analysis
- USA
- UK
- Canada
- India
